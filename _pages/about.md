I'm a second-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Melkior Ornik](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/) at the LEADCAT group.

I am broadly interested in problems in control, learning and optimization. I am currently focused on optimal control and resilience of systems whose dynamics are affected by system faults or adversaries. In relation to this, I have worked on quantifying the resilience of nonlinear dynamical systems under partial adversarial actions.

I am currently working on designing controllers for systems suffering such adversarial attacks, as well as quantifying resilience of nonlinear networks. I am also interested in problems relating to deceiving adversaries in stochastic environments.

I received my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I worked with [Prof. Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/) on analyzing the effect of varying step sizes on the convergence and noise amplification of gradient descent.

You can find my CV [here](https://ram-p.github.io/files/CV_RP.pdf), and my Google Scholar page [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YtKKnAEAAAAJ&hl=en).
