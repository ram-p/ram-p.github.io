I'm a second-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Melkior Ornik](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/) at the LEADCAT group.

I am broadly interested in problems in control, learning and optimization. I am currently focused on optimal control and resilience of systems whose dynamics are affected by system faults or adversaries. In relation to this, I have worked on quantifying the resilience of nonlinear dynamical systems under partial adversarial actions.

I am currently working on designing controllers for systems suffering such adversarial attacks, in a theoretically rigorous and scalable manner. I am also interested in quantifying resilience of nonlinear networks and in problems relating to deceiving adversaries in stochastic environments.

I received my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I worked with [Prof. Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/) on analyzing the effect of varying step sizes on the convergence and noise amplification of gradient descent.

You can find my CV [here](https://ram-p.github.io/files/CV_RP.pdf), and my Google Scholar page [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YtKKnAEAAAAJ&hl=en).

News
------
- October 9, 2025 — I was at the [_5th Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC)_](https://mecc2025.a2c2.org/) this week, presenting our paper ["Analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller for Systems with Bounded Nonlinearities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08579).

- September 16, 2025 — Submitted a paper ["Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453). This paper uses Theory of Mind (ToM) to inform online reinforcement learning (RL), and thus design deceptive policies for an agent in the setting of supervisory control.

- September 8, 2025 — Submitted a new paper ["Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06188). This paper presents a novel method to control input-constrained nonlinear systems using optimal controllers for driftless systems, applied over successively shorter horizons.

- July 4, 2025 — I was at the [11th IFAC Symposium on Robust Control Design](https://conferences.ifac-control.org/rocond2025/) this week, and was selected as a finalist for the IFAC Young Author Award for our paper ["Energetic Resilience of Linear Driftless Systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00323).

- June 24, 2025 — Our paper ["Analysis of the Unscented Transform Controller for Systems with Bounded Nonlinearities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08579) has been accepted for presentation at the [_5th Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC)_](https://mecc2025.a2c2.org/) in October!

- June 8, 2025 — Our paper ["Mode-Prefix-Based Control of Switched Linear Systems with Applications to Fault Tolerance"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13105) has been accepted to _IEEE Control Systems Letters_!
